Several frameworks and legal regulations have been adopted to clarify and define the various ethical challenges in digital contexts. These initiatives often accentuate one of three components: data security, data governance, or digital strategy. However, an integrated approach is required to meet the current demand for an ethical and sustainable approach to digitalization and address the growing number of challenges occurring in handling data and related peripheral components. This paper develops the concept of an integrated framework to incorporate all relevant aspects of digital ethics by combining three categories of digital contexts: law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. The core of this integrated framework, the Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework (FSDEF), consists of two boundary conditions of sustainable development: social thresholds of justice and ecological planetary boundaries. It also incorporates numerous other frameworks and standards, including value-based engineering and IEEE standards.",Digital ethics;sustainability;corporate digital responsibility,"UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland",13 Sep 2021,,,156.0,162.0,2573-1998,978-1-6654-2512-4,,Ethics;Law;Data security;Green products;Companies;IEEE Standards;Regulation,data governance;environmental factors;ethical aspects;IEEE standards;law;public administration;security of data;sustainable development,sustainable digitalization;digitization initiatives;legal regulations;data security;data governance;digital strategy;peripheral components;justice;environmental sustainability;Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework;sustainable development;ethical digitalization;data handling;law;regulations;ethics;FSDEF;value-based engineering;IEEE standards;public institutions;private companies,,2.0,20.0,IEEE,13 Sep 2021,IEEE,0.1925465838509316,1.25,0.375,0.2505032957755626

The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process.",AI ethics;AI governance;responsible AI;impact assessment;risk-based approach,"Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan",20 Oct 2022,,,152.0,161.0,2770-6834,978-1-6654-6000-2,Stanford University; ,Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Conferences;Europe;Organizations;Regulation;Requirements engineering,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects,artificial intelligence systems;AI ethics guidelines;AI service providers;ethical risks;ethical AI systems;AI ethics impact assessment;requirement engineering,,2.0,27.0,IEEE,20 Oct 2022,IEEE,0.1841004184100418,0.1666666666666666,0.375,0.1902169701992332

Based on a sample of 34 companies, out of which 23 were sanctioned under GDPR due to severe violations of AI ethical principles and using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this study demonstrates that to be an AI ethical company and comply with the GDPR regulation, it is necessary to have an AI ethical statement, have a very strong concern for information cybersecurity, and have to be based in a country considered ethical or monitor with care the behavior of the firm in countries with lower ethical standards. As a theoretical contribution, although some authors argue that AI ethical principles are useless, the present research introduces a new theoretical perspective by demonstrating cause–effect relationships between business configurations and AI ethical failures.

In response to recent controversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices of “tech ethics” have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil society, and government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics in practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations suggest that tech ethics enables corporate “ethics-washing”: embracing the language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation, without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether ethics is desirable, but what “ethics” entails and who gets to define it. Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and technology companies to label themselves as “ethical” without substantively altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of normative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose a sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it and what impacts it generates in practice.",technology ethics;AI ethics;ethics-washing;Science;Technology;and Society (STS);sociotechnical systems,"Society of Fellows and the Gerald R.

The experience of taking the quiz, and the feedback it provides, will help AI practitioners understand the gap areas, and improve their overall ethical practice in everyday development scenarios. To demonstrate these expected outcomes and the relevance of our tool, we also share a preliminary user study.

In this work, we first provide a model to quantitatively assess constitutive ethics, i.e., the intrinsic ethical compliance of a technology. Secondly, we propose a method for quantitatively assessing circumstantial ethics risks of a technology, when used in some specific context. Our ethics risk assessment model is based on the evaluation of the compliance of the technology to a defined set of controls about some ethical principles and about the robustness of the technological infrastructure underneath. Then, we validate our model by applying it to some recent healthrelated blockchain frameworks, and we compare a qualitative ethical assessment with the quantitative assessment made with the proposed model for constitutive ethics compliance.

Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies adhere to ethical well-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines are still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics principles and relevant challenges, we conducted a survey of 99 randomly selected representative AI practitioners and lawmakers (e.g., AI engineers and lawyers) from 20 countries across five continents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that unveils the perceptions of two different types of population (AI practitioners and lawmakers) and the study findings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most critical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no legal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found to be the most common AI ethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across principles reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Moreover, the perceptions of practitioners and lawmakers are statistically correlated with significant differences for particular principles (e.g. fairness and freedom) and challenges (e.g. lacking monitoring bodies and machine distortion).

With recourse to phenomenological methods, TEDS helps to address ethical implications which arise from deep interference of autonomous systems with the human lifeworld. The meaning of intentional structures and the problem of appresentations in the phenomenological sense still represents a blank gap in the current ethical discourse on the problem of data breaches. The findings provide methods for dealing with ethical challenges and explain the problem area of an appropriate technoethical use in the lifeworld. In this way, problems can already be avoided in the development process of artificial intelligence systems and their applications by specifically searching for blind spots in a technical and ethical manner. Furthermore, this approach helps to assure a technoethical use of autonomous systems in an appropriate way and ultimately leads to a limitation of damages – which may occur in case of malfunctions and data breaches of artificial intelligence systems – in the lifeworld of humans.
